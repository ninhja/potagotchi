# Potagotchi: grow your own planter
CS 194-28: Computational Design & Fabrication, Spring 2019

# Monday 4/1/2019 Notes:
- Googled similar projects 
- Looked into Processing for Arduino (not user friendly) 
- Three.js: source code, documentation
- Export as STL: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27716404/exporting-three-js-scene-to-stl-keeping-animations-intact
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/exporters/STLExporter.js
- NPM
https://www.npmjs.com/package/threejs-export-stl
- 8 javascript libraries for computation design/fab

- CGA.js = Computational Geometry Algorithms 
Collection of basic geometry algorithms written in javascript, including line intersection, triangulation, and polygon expansion 
https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/cga.js 
- MDA.js = Mesh Data Structure & Algorithms
https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/mda.js

Cool Examples:
- Random harmonic sphere generator. Good UI w/ sliders to adjust settings, similarities in code

New Stretch Goals:
- Physical interface
- Giant Tamagotchi: Use Melissaâ€™s laptop (flexible, touch screen) and laser cut an egg shell around it, use mouse for buttons
